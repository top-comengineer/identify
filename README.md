## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

After proper configuration of `environment.ts` and `environment.prod.ts`, run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Format

Formatting will happen upon commit. Developers can also run `npm run format` or `npx npm run format` if npm isn't installed to format all source files
